                Hi! I'm Parker Stuart—an enthusiastic developer and artist with a deep passion for games. My primary focus is 3D art, but I also enjoy scripting and creating 2D art.
                <br><br>
                Games have been a fundamental part of my life for as long as I can remember, shaping who I am today. My dream is to craft life-changing experiences that resonate with players, just as the games I’ve loved have done for me.
