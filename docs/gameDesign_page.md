## HexaGOON
This character was made for a game project that I worked on collaboratively with students at Drexel University to make HexaGONE. 

This game is a couch brawler with up to 4 players. Each Hex has different effects, so use the map to your advantage while bashing your friends!

I created the character for this game, bringing it all the way from concept sketches to programming the character’s movement. Animations from Mixamo were used to bring the 
character to life.

## Game Ready Sword
This project was to create a game ready asset from start to finish. 

By ideating through various different weapons, I settled upon a few designs that I wanted to move forward with. After settling upon the serrated sword, I created a game ready model with textures. 

All work through the pipeline is my own except for the Unity Scene and animations used to showcase the asset.

## SCAVENGER
SCAVENGER is a top down shooter game made to be played in the browser on desktop. In this game, the player must earn as many galactic credits as they can before the spaceship takes off, leaving you stranded on Earth. 

This game was the final project for my first Game Programming course at Drexel University. All assets and code in the game were created by me in one week with the exception of the sound effects and background music which were sourced royalty free.
