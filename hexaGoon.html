            <p>
                This character was made for a game project that I worked on collaboratively with students at Drexel University to make HexaGONE.<br><br>This game is a couch brawler with up to 4 players. Each Hex has different effects, so use the map to your advantage while bashing your friends!<br><br>I created the character for this game, bringing it all the way from concept sketches to programming the characterâ€™s movement. Animations from Mixamo were used to bring the character to life.
