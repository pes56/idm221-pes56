                SCAVENGER is a top down shooter game made to be played in the browser on desktop. In this game, the player must earn as many galactic credits as they can before the spaceship takes off, leaving you stranded on Earth.<br><br>This game was the final project for my first Game Programming course at Drexel University. All assets and code in the game were created by me in one week with the exception of the sound effects and background music which were sourced royalty free.
