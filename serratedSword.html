                This project was to create a game ready asset from start to finish. By ideating through various different weapons, I settled upon a few designs that I wanted to move forward with. After settling upon the serrated sword, I created a game ready model with textures. All work through the pipeline is my own except for the Unity Scene and animations used to showcase the asset.
